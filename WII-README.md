Needs "wii-portlibs" installed

To run on Dolphin, the project's .pck needs to be placed at "/godot_app.pck" on the SD card and inserted. This is required even if "Embed PCK" is selected. This is an unintentional side effect, and will hopefully be fixed.
Alternatively, if the project is built with "Embed PCK", you can place "/godot_app.elf" on the SD card.
